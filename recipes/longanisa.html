    <h2>A Breakfast Staple</h2>
    <p>Longanisa is a sweet and savoury sausage that is best paired with fried eggs and garlic rice. It could be stuffed in a sausage casing or simply moulded into your preferred shape, ready to be fried.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1lb ground pork</li>
            <li>10 tbsp brown sugar</li>
            <li>6 tbsp pineapple juice</li>   
            <li>2 tbsp cornstarch</li>
            <li>2 tbsp oyster sauce</li>
            <li>2 tsp salt</li>
            <li>2 tsp paprika</li>
            <li>1 tsp MSG (optional)</li>
            <li>1 tsp black pepper</li>
            <li>1 head chopped garlic</li>
        </ul>

            <li>Finely mince 1 head of garlic.</li>
