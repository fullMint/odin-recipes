    <h2>Your Stomach Says Yes, Your Heart Says No</h2>
    <p>As much as I love my mother-in-law's fried spare ribs, my heart will always belong to my one true love of Filipino food—lechon kawali, or boiled and deep-fried pork belly. The exterior of lechon kawali is salty and extra-crispy, while the interior is tender and moist with fat and juicy meat. It's a rich combination that pairs extremely well with the mild tartness of cane vinegar, which cuts through the fat just enough to make eating a whole plate of fried pork a dangerously simple task.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <Li>2 pounds (900 g) boneless skin-on pork belly, cut in half</Li>
        <Li>8 medium cloves garlic, smashed</Li>
        <Li>2 bay leaves</Li>
        <Li>1 tablespoon black peppercorns</Li>
        <Li>1/2 cup (120 ml) soy sauce</Li>
        <Li>Kosher salt</Li>
        <Li>Canola or peanut oil, for frying</Li>
        <Li>Rice or cane vinegar, preferably spicy, or Lechon sauce (such as Mang Tomas), for dipping</Li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large pot, place pork belly skin side down and add enough water to completely submerge meat. Add garlic, bay leaves, peppercorns, and soy sauce. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then lower heat and reduce to a simmer. Cover and cook until pork skin can be pierced with a knife with no resistance, about 1 hour. Transfer pork to a wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet and season liberally with salt all over. Refrigerate pork until skin has completely dried, 6 hours or overnight.</li>
        <li>Remove pork from refrigerator and cut into 2-inch slices.</li>
        <li>Fill a wok or Dutch oven with at least 4 inches oil and heat to 375°F (190°C) over high heat. Working in batches, fry pork until deeply browned and skin has bubbled and crisped, 7 to 10 minutes. Transfer pork to a paper towel-lined plate and season with salt to taste. Cut pork slices into 1-inch pieces. Serve immediately with vinegar or Lechon sauce for dipping.</li>
    </ol>
