    <h2>A Healthy Umami Bomb</h2>
    <p>Pinakbet is a pungent Filipino vegetable stew made by simmering a variety of vegetables with shrimp or lechon kawali (crispy fried pork belly) in a fermented seafood-infused broth. The dish originated on the northern island of Luzon and has since spread throughout the country and abroad. Served alongside cooked white rice and fried or grilled fish and meat, this nourishing dish is a staple on Filipino dinner tables.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 bitter melon (about 8 ounces; 225 g), halved lengthwise, seeded, cut into 1/4-inch-thick slices (optional)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons (30 ml) vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 small yellow onion (4 ounces; 115 g), finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 medium garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>2 plum tomatoes (about 8 ounces; 225 g), cored and chopped</li>
        <li>2 ounces (1/4 cup; 60 g) ginisang bagoong (see notes)</li>
        <li>2 cups (475 ml) homemade or instant dashi</li>
        <li>1 small sweet potato (about 8 ounces; 225 g), peeled, quartered, and cut into 1/4-inch slices</li>
        <li>8 ounces (225 g) Chinese long beans or string beans, stem ends trimmed and beans cut into 2-inch lengths</li>
        <li>1 medium Japanese eggplant (about 6 ounces; 170 g), halved lengthwise, and cut into 1/2-inch-thick slices</li>
        <li>8 ounces (225 g) okra, caps trimmed, pods cut in half on a bias</li>
        <li>Cooked white rice, for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>If using bitter melon, combine 2 cups (475ml) water and 2 teaspoons (8g) salt in a medium bowl, and whisk to dissolve. Add bitter melon, and stir to combine. Set aside for at least 30 minutes and up to 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, in a 4-quart stainless-steel saucier or saucepan, heat oil over medium heat until shimmering. Add onion and garlic, season lightly with salt, and cook, stirring frequently, until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add tomatoes and cook, stirring occasionally, until theyâ€™ve softened and released their liquid, about 5 minutes. Add ginisang bagoong and stir until well incorporated, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Add dashi, bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to a simmer. Add sweet potato and green beans. Cover and cook until vegetables are tender enough to be pierced with a knife, but not completely cooked through, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Drain bitter melon (if using), and add to saucepan along with eggplant, and okra. Cover and continue to cook until all vegetables are tender and completely cooked through, about 10 minutes. Season with salt to taste.</li>
        <li>Transfer to individual serving bowls and serve immediately with white rice.</li>
